# DIGIT RECOGNITION

This is a simple digit recognition project which can recognize the digits(0-9) present in the image.
For now, it is only capable of recognizing digits.

## Dataset
For digits, I have used the MNIST dataset.

## Model
For the model I have Dense Architecture

## Usage
First install the required modules from requirements.txt

### Testing the model
If you would like to test the model, you can run GUI_Predict.py and try.
Here is the sample output you could expect.
